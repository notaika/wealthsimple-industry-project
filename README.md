# Wealthsimple Industry Project

## Meet the Team
Presented by Cyber Squatters | Aika, Tina, Brittany and Megha

## Problem Space
How might we help Wealthsimple clients in Canada to improve their financial literacy and make better personal finance decisions?

## Our Solution

## App Notes
- The app was mainly based off the wealthsimple phone app. We decided to do a simple coded app rather than using figma to show basic functionality (but also mainly because we are a team of developers with little figma experience...)
    - With that being said, everything is hard-coded and we'd like to highlight that this app contains simple functionality and doesn't explore the depths of logic and back-end, but will be explained during the presentation.
- Everything is to be viewed strictly in 445px x 979px as we based it off the app screenshot.
- The hard-coded functionality only shows one possible example of each functionality and scenario.
